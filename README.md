# EV-Data-Analysis-Project
Python Project analyzing Electric Vehicle dataset (range, battery, energy consumption, recommendations)
# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of electric vehicles (EVs) to explore:
- Vehicle specifications (price, battery, range, etc.)
- Outlier detection in energy consumption
- Relationship between battery capacity & driving range
- EV recommendation system based on user preferences
- Hypothesis testing between Tesla and Audi engine power
